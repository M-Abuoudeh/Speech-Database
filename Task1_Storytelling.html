        <h2>Task description </h2>
        <p>
            After completing the task of reading the story "Laylaa witheeb" (Little Red Riding Hood), participants were asked to narrate the same story without reading or referring to the original text.

Participants were instructed to recount the story as if they were telling it to a family member, using their own dialect as naturally and authentically as possible. This task aimed to capture spontaneous speech and narrative skills in their native dialect, providing valuable insights into the phonetic and lexical variations of Jordanian Arabic in informal storytelling contexts.
