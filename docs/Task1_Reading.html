        <h2>Task description </h2>
        <p>
            This task involves reading "Laylaa witheeb" (ليلى والذئب) story, which is a version of the well-known tale 'Little red riding hood' written by the experimenter in Arabic script. The story was displayed on a computer screen, and participants were asked to read it aloud in their own Jordanian dialect.

Participants were instructed to adapt the story to match their dialectal preferences. If any word in the provided text did not align with how it is said in their dialect, they were encouraged to replace it with the appropriate equivalent from their local speech. This approach allowed the recordings to authentically reflect the phonetic characteristics and lexical choices of each participant's dialect.
